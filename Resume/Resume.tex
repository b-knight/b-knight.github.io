Used Python to sessionize tens of millions of events into a materialized view on a Redshift cluster. Applied dimension reduction (PCA, feature pruning on variance inflation factor) to the resulting 15 gigabyte data set. Employed linear \& kernel SVM to create a binary classification model of conversion to paying customer as function of behavior on the company marketing site.}

Used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) in R with custom HTML and CSS to visualize typical customer time in-app as a function of operational complexity. Winner of Hax Day 2016 and subsequently utilized as part of a mid-market outbounding campaign.}}}

%\item{\textbf{3rd year individual project:} \textit{'Artificial Neural Network Approach to Source Localisation in Radiation Portal Monitoring'}

%\vspace{3pt}

%\small{This challenging project took place over the entirety of my third year. It required excellent planning and organisational skills, and the ability to teach myself an entirely new and complex subject. The project was a success, with the system being able to localise a radioactive source down to $ 3 cm$ within a $ 600 m^3$ sensor array. This project has been suggested for publication by my supervisor.}}

%\section{Interests and extra-curricular activity}

%\vspace{6pt}

%\begin{itemize}

%\item{I was a "fresher representative" in my 2nd and 3rd years of university, this required me to guide, look after, and ensure that a particular flat of first years have a good time in their first week, and feel consoled in what for most of them is there first time living away from home. We were responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the group of first years during the first week, and during this time I made good friends with all of them.}

%\vspace{6pt}

%\item{I am a member of a number of university societies. I was also the vice president and co-founder of the flash mob society. My roles in this included recruiting members, in which during "fresher's fair" we enlisted over 200 new members. This was regarded as very successful, considering other societies averaged around 50. I also appeared in an interview on the university television station, set up a society bank account, and helped organise the events. One of these events was featured in the local newspaper.}

%\item{I am also an avid hiker, having completed the national 3 peaks challenge last summer. Other interest include guitar, which I am self-taught, and home brewing.}
